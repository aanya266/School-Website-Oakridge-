                “The carefully planned timetable is a seamless blend of various lesson plans, break times, offline engagement activities and social interactions that allow students to stay engaged and aids their holistic development. Following a well laid out routine gives children a sense of security and control over their environment. As they begin to participate in these routines, they will experience a sense of satisfaction at being able to perform the tasks that enhance their confidence further”, says Hema Chennupaty, Principal, Oakridge International School Gachibowli.

He is not only an IBDP topper (45/45 score) but is also a Harvard MUN Delegate, a TEDx Speaker, Head Boy and an avid artist. I was titled ‘World Topper’ with a perfect 45 by achieving the highest possible IB score with a 7 in all the subjects. I have even gven a TedTalk on ‘What I learned as an LGBT activist’ and was listed among the top-15 inspiring Ted Talks on Polka Cafe. But beyond my academic achievements, I am also a passionate artist, where I view art as a medium to investigate the roles we play as wanderers in an ever expanding universe. I’ve had an exhibition titled ‘Infinite Journey’ featured at the Kalakriti Art Gallery.<br>
